# Selenium / Cucumber 

Assignment for my course in Test Automation where I showcase skills in Selenium and Cucumber. 

Cucumber is used to describe the expected behaviour using natural language that anybody could read, in order to follow Behaviour Driven Development. Scenario outline, variables and examples are used to reduce rewriting similar test cases.

Cucumber specifications are coupled with test code in Java and using Selenium WebDriver, functional tests are automated, to confirm the wanted behaviour of the Web Application.
